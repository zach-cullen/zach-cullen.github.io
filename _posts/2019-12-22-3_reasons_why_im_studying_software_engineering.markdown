**1. To Create**

There is nothing more fulfillng than to make something out of nothing. That's what drew me to my first career in video production and entrepreneurship, and it's what is inspiring me now to learn sofware engineering. 

While studying film and mass media in college, I made it my mission to gain as many different creative skills as possible. My biggest goal was to start my own business, and I knew it would all add up to being able to bootstrap my marketing and branding. At the top of the list of skills I knew I would need was web design. I was intimidated by code at first but after my first class in HTML and CSS I was hooked on coding and continued on to learn how to animate websites with jQuery. Once I graduated, I started freelancing in both web design and video, but because I initially was making more money in video I ended up going down that route full time and built a small video production company.

Seven years later, I am feeling called back to code. But this time, I want to go even deeper and learn the full stack so that I can build web and mobile applications. My goal is to build software products that are beautifully designed, fun to use, and maybe even to start another business some day.


**2. To Take On Bigger Challenges**

Software engineering isn't just about building widgets, it's about solving problems. More and more, I am measuring success in my life and career by contribution rather than compensation. The world is facing huge challenges like climate change, public health decline and global inequality. I hope that by learning to harness the power of technology I can be a part of solving some of these problems and moving the world forward just a little bit.

I've also learned that the greater the challenge I take on, the more enjoyment I get from the pursuit. I know that it won't be easy to become a great software engineer, but the journey will be worth it. I love to learn, and I love to be challenged.

**3. Because the Future is Awesome**

We live in an amazing time. The amount of information we have at our fingertips at any moment is incomprehensible. The world is more connected than ever and continuing to be even more so. Advancements in artificial intelligence are already starting to change the way we interact with the world and with our tools. Technology is transforming every aspect of our daily lives to the point where we almost can't imagine what life will look like in a couple of decades. 

This massive wave of change presents all of us with a choice â€“ we can duck under the water in fear and try to let it pass over us, or we can start paddling with it and try to ride it. As for me, I want to become one with the wave and enjoy this ride. I don't want to be someone who change just happens to, I to change on purpose. I don't want to just learn how to use technology, I want to learn to build it so I can understand it deeply.
